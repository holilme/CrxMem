# 🎮 CrxMem - Efficient Memory Scanning Made Easy

## 🌟 Overview
CrxMem is an open-source memory scanner and debugger suite for Windows. It is inspired by CheatEngine and includes three main components: **CrxMem** (the main application), **CrxShield** (a kernel driver for added security), and **VEHDebugDll** (a debugging library). This tool aims to simplify the process of memory editing, making it accessible for non-programmers interested in game modifications and debugging tasks.
